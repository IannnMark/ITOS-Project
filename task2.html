        <h1>Number System</h1>

        <br>

    <p>A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing
    numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. It provides a unique representation of
    every number and represents the arithmetic and algebraic structure of the figures. It also allows us to operate
    arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>

    <h2>Types of Binary Number System</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Decimal number system (Base- 10)</li>
        <li>Binary number system (Base- 2)</li>
        <li>Octal number system (Base-8)</li>
        <li>Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Decimal number system</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The decimal number system has a base of 10 because it uses ten digits from 0 to 9. In the decimal number system, the
    positions successive to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. This system
    is expressed in decimal numbers. Every position shows a particular power of the base (10).</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Binary number system</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The base 2 number system is also known as the Binary number system wherein, only two binary digits exist, i.e., 0 and 1.
    Specifically, the usual base-2 is a radix of 2. The figures described under this system are known as binary numbers
    which are the combination of 0 and 1. For example, 110101 is a binary number.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Octal number system</h3>
    <br>
  <p>In the octal number system, the base is 8 and it uses numbers from 0 to 7 to represent numbers. Octal numbers are
commonly used in computer applications.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Hexadecimal number system</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In the hexadecimal system, numbers are written or represented with base 16. In the hexadecimal system, the numbers are
    first represented just like in the decimal system, i.e. from 0 to 9. Then, the numbers are represented using the
    alphabet from A to F.</p>
