      <br />

      <p>
        A computing platform or digital platform is an environment in which a
        piece of software is executed. It may be the hardware or the operating
        system (OS), even a web browser and associated application programming
        interfaces, or other underlying software, as long as the program code is
        executed with it.

      <h2>What are the different types of computing platform?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mainframe Computers</li>
        <li>Minicomputers</li>
        <li>Personal Computers</li>
      </ul>

      <br />

      <h3>Mainframe Computers</h3>

      />
      <p>
        Mainframes are computers. At their core, mainframes are high-performance
        computers with large amounts of memory and processors that process
        billions of simple calculations and transactions in real time.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Minicomputers</h3>
      <br />
      <img src="img/minicomputer" alt="MiniComputer" height="240" width="240" />
      <p>
        minicomputer, computer that was smaller, less expensive, and less
        powerful than a mainframe or supercomputer but more expensive and more
        powerful than a personal computer. Minicomputers were used for
        scientific and engineering computations, business transaction
        processing, file handling, and database management.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Personal Computer</h3>
      <br />
      <img src="img/pc.jpeg" alt="PersonalComputer" height="240" width="240" />
      <p>
        A personal computer (PC) is a microcomputer designed for use by one
        person at a time. Prior to the PC, computers were designed for -- and
        only affordable for -- companies that attached terminals for multiple
        users to a single large mainframe computer whose resources were shared
        among all users.
