      <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>

      <br />

      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to
        perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as
        learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI has become an
        increasingly important field in recent years due to advancements in
        computer technology and the availability of vast amounts of data for
        training algorithms.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>Types of AI</h3>

      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>Reactive Machines AI</li>
        <li>Limited Memory AI</li>
        <li>Theory Of Mind AI</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>Reactive Machines AI</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        This type of AI includes machines that operate solely based on the
        present data, taking into account only the current situation. Reactive
        AI machines cannot form inferences from the data to evaluate their
        future actions. They can perform a narrowed range of pre-defined tasks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Limited Memory AI</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Like the name suggests Limited Memory AI, can make informed and improved
        decisions by studying the past data from its memory. Such an AI has a
        short-lived or a temporary memory that can be used to store past
        experiences and hence evaluate future actions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Theory of Mind AI</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Theory Of Mind AI is a more advanced type of Artificial
        Intelligence. This category of machines is speculated to play a major
        role in psychology. This type of AI will focus mainly on emotional
        intelligence so that human believes and thoughts can be better
        comprehended.
