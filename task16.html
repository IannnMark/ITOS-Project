      <h1>Security</h1>

      <br />

      <p>
        In today's world, gadgets have become an integral part of our lives.
        From smartphones to laptops, tablets to wearables, gadgets have
        revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. However, with the
        increasing use of gadgets, security has become a major concern. Cyber
        threats, data breaches, and hacking attacks have become common, posing a
        threat to the privacy and security of our personal information.

      <h3>Different Platform Technologies Applied for Security</h3>

      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>Secure Boot</li>
        <li>Encryption</li>
        <li>Two-Factor Authentication</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>Secure Boot</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Secure boot is a platform technology that ensures that only trusted
        software is loaded on a device during startup. This technology checks
        the digital signature of the software and ensures that it has not been
        tampered with or modified. This helps to prevent malware and other
        malicious software from being loaded onto the device during startup.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Encryption</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Encryption is a platform technology that is used to protect data stored
        on a device. Encryption works by converting data into an unreadable
        format that can only be deciphered using a specific key. This helps to
        prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, even if the device is
        lost or stolen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Two Factor Authentication</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security technology that requires
        users to provide two forms of identification before accessing a device
        or application.
